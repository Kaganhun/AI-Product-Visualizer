**Stop paying for mockups and photoshoots. Generate stunning, context-rich marketing visuals instantly using the power of Gemini.**

---

## üåü Overview

The process of taking a single product design and creating high-quality, realistic marketing mockups for various channels‚Äîfrom a social media post to a massive billboard‚Äîis traditionally expensive, time-consuming, and reliant on complex design software.

**AI Product Visualizer** revolutionizes this workflow. Upload one clean product image, and our application, powered by Google's Gemini generative models, instantly places your product realistically onto a vast range of real-world and conceptual mediums. Furthermore, users maintain creative control by editing the generated scene using simple text prompts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |

## üí° How It Works (The 3-Step Workflow)

The entire process is designed to be intuitive, even for non-designers:

1.  **Upload & Select:** Upload your clean product image (e.g., a logo, a flat clothing design, a bottle label).
2.  **Define the Medium:** Select your desired medium from the gallery (e.g., "Billboard in a busy city," "Vintage T-Shirt," "Ceramic Coffee Mug"). You can also define a custom medium via text prompt.
3.  **Generate & Refine:**
    *   The AI generates the initial, photorealistic mockup.
    *   (Optional) Use the **Text-Prompt Editor** to refine the image: *"Make the background a beach at sunset"* or *"Change the mug finish to matte black."*
